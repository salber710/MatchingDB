# MatchingDB
 
Given a list of MDB members names and photos, this application creates a trivia-based game where the user is given a photo of a MDB member and tries to select the correct name of the MDB member given four options. The user has 5 seconds to answer each question and, if they get it right, their score increases by one. When they select an option, the button briefly flashes red or green, depending on if the answer is wrong or right respectively, before moving on to the next question. At the bottom of the options, there is a quit button where the user is given the option to either go back to the Start screen or continue on with the quiz.
